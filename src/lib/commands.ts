<b>OS Telemetry (May 2024)</b>:  
- Worked on the development of a live monitoring tool for Linux subsystems, researching and identifying appropriate tools for live monitoring. Crafted custom monitoring solutions using Bash scripting to configure tools tailored to our requirements, facilitating direct and secure data transmission to the cloud.  
- Utilized various monitoring tools, including Tshark for network analysis, Auditd for kernel auditing, Inotify for file system changes, and Sar for memory performance analysis. Implemented Iostat, Ioping, and Iotop for input/output operations, along with Top for real-time process monitoring. Directly sent all generated monitoring data to the cloud for storage.

<b>Red Teaming Framework Tool (Nov 2023)</b>:  
- Developed a comprehensive security tool for domain scanning, automating the discovery of subdomains using tools such as Sublist3r, Subfinder, and Assetfinder. Integrated live domain checks with Httprobe and employed LinkFinder and regex to extract JavaScript links for further analysis.  
- Employed Nmap to scan open ports. Utilized Nuclei to identify known vulnerabilities, and Wappalyzer for technology stack identification, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) effectively retrieving relevant Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). Automated the entire scanning process, with results securely stored in AWS S3 and MongoDB.
